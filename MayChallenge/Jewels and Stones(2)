You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string J, string S) {
        int n=J.length();
        int count=0;
        int a= S.length();
        for (int i=0;i<n;i++)
        { 
            for (int j=0;j<a;j++ ){
                             if (J[i]==S[j])
{
    count++;
}
        }
        }
    
    return count;
    }
};
