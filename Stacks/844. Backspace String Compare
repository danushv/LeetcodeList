In this problem what we are expected to do is String manipulation
Which means if u get to c '#' then we have to backspace or delete the previous element

So lets see a step by step implementation

class Solution {
    public boolean backspaceCompare(String S, String T) {
        return develop(S).equals(develop(T));
    }
    //So lets create a function which does this operation
    public String develop(String A)
    {
    
    // i am creating a stack
        Stack<Character> ans=new Stack();
        // Since it is a string and are immutable we have to convert to char array and traverse in that array elements will be stored as Char
        for (char s:A.toCharArray()){
            
            if(s!='#')
            {
                ans.push(s);
            }
            else if(!ans.empty())
            {
                ans.pop();
            }
        }
         so we work in char thats why i have created a character stack but i have to return as string so now we can easily convert it
        return String.valueOf(ans);
    }
}
